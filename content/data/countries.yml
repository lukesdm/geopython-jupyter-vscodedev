    title: Admin 0 - Countries
    abstract: Countries distinguish between metropolitan (homeland) and independent and semi-independent portions of sovereign states. If you want to see the dependent overseas regions broken out (like in ISO codes, see France for example), use map units instead.  Each country is coded with a world region that roughly follows the United Nations setup.  Includes some thematic data from the United Nations, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, and elsewhere.
