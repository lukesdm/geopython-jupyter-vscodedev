    "## Overview\n",
    "Dissemination is a key component of any geospatial data management lifecycle and the Internet is the key gateway in sharing your data with others.  Putting your data on the web has never been easier with services from Google, GitHub, Amazon, Azure, DigitalOcean and others, as well as numerous tooling for making data available through application programming interfaces (APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishing geospatial geospatial data has varying degrees of complexity.  From simply posting files to a web server to provisioning services and APIs, there are no shortage on mechanisms to publish your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will focus on basic data and metadata publishing using [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io) (which supports numerous [OGC API](https://ogcapi.org) standards) and [pycsw](https://pycsw.org) (which supports the OGC Catalogue Serivice for the Web [CSW] specification).  Thus the basic workflow is as follows:\n",
