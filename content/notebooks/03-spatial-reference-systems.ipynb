    "# Spatial Reference Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Short Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A Spatial Reference System (SRS) is a mathematical construct that is essential to the discipline of Geography. It has two important roles:\n",
    " 1. identify unequivocally and with precision the location of a spatial object;\n",
    " 2. accurately portray spatial objects in maps. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form a SRS is composed by two elements:\n",
    " 1. *Datum* - a sphere or ellipsoid that approximates the shape of the Earth, positioned relative to the latter. \n",
    " 2. *Cartographic Projection* - a set of mathematical functions that translate locations in the surface of the *datum* into the Cartesian plane.\n",
    " \n",
    "The World Geodetic System (WGS 84) is a collection of *datums* maintained by the  National\n",
    "Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) of the USA that approximate the surface of the Earth as a whole. Most GPS or GNSS receivers today report geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) in reference to one of the WGS 84 *datums*. For global cartography the WGS 84 can be a convenient choice, but for local mapping a bespoke *datum* is  more appropriate in most circumstances. National surveys defined specific *datums* that closely suit their country or region.\n",

    "*Sketch of geodesic data positioned relative to the Earth's surface. Source: [Wikipaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodetic_datum).* \n",
    "\n",
    "The Marinus of Tyre and Mercator projections are the most popular today, however, none of them is suited for either local or global cartography (apart from navigation applications in the case of Mercator). It is always useful to spend some time identifying the most appropriate projection for the work at hand. Cartographic projections introduce errors as they flatten the curved surface of the Earth onto a plane. A balance must be struck between the accuracy of areas, shapes and angles. For global mapping, projections like [Mollweide's Homolographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollweide_projection), [Eckert IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eckert_IV_projection) or [Goode's Homolosine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goode_homolosine_projection) present interesting compromises. For local mapping, the [Stereographic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection#Applications_to_other_disciplines), [Lambert's Azimutal Equal-Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambert_azimuthal_equal-area_projection) and [Gauss-Krüger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transverse_Mercator_projection#Ellipsoidal_transverse_Mercator) are popular choices, but many more exist.\n",

    "*Visual examples of the transformations applied to the *datum* by simple map projections. Source: [Wikipaedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection).*\n",
    "\n",
    "Always keep in mind one thing: no cartographic projection is able to preserve distances correctly. Therefore avoid computing distances in the Cartesian plane, as they will be wrong. In small study areas the error might be negligible, but at global or continental scales, even for large countries like Russia, distances computed on the Cartesian plane are significantly off. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Python libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "The GDAL/OGR Python API library includes a dedicated module to handle Spatial Reference Systems (SRS): [osgeo.osr](https://gdal.org/python/osgeo.osr-pysrc.html). This module makes it rather simple to parametrise SRSs and transform coordinates between.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PROJ](https://proj.org) library is a cornerstone of FOSS4G that implements a large number of cartographic projections. GDAL supports most of the projections implemented by PROJ, therefore they are also available to the `osgeo.osr` module. The list of [cartographic projections implemented by PROJ](https://proj.org/operations/projections/index.html) is a good place to start exploring the different characteristic of each projection. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Create a new Spatial Reference object\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `osr` module the concept of SRS is encapsulated in the `SpatialReference` class. A SRS can be parametrised with an object of this class in different ways. The simplest is possibly using a [PROJ string](https://proj.org/usage/quickstart.html), a synthetic and expressive set of parameters in a character string. This is made through the `ImportFromProj4`method:"

    "The [European Petroleum Survey Group (EPSG)](http://wiki.gis.com/wiki/index.php/European_Petroleum_Survey_Group) was a scientific body supporting the Petroluem & Gas industry in Europe. It developed an [extensive database](http://www.epsg.org/) of parameters and complete SRS definitions, that helped the industry standardise its cartographic processes. The EPSG assigned a unique numerical identifier to each entry in its database, which became rather handy to quickly refer to a specific, well defined, SRS. Most open source geospatial software support the EPSG identifiers as quick reference (some even enforce it). Tools such as [epsg.io](https://epsg.io) provide quick and easy verification of EPSG codes. PROJ and GDAL are no exceptions, and therefore `SpatialReference` objects can too be initialised with an EPSG identifier:"
